my first project using yii2.
this was a great experience using a new web framework
there were alot of errors in between which had to be rectified, which was really time consuming(firstly to understand the error then to rectify it).
i have completed till sqlite database.
i couldn't do the mysql portions due to errors which were very difficult to rectify.
